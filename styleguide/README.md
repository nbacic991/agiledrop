# Styleguide

Main idea with styleguide is to have HTML/CSS (with Sass) of the components used in a web site.

This enables **backend** developers to work on their part as they can and then, when styleguide is ready, to use components and substitute their code for real **frontend** code.

We are also evaluating [pattern lab](http://patternlab.io/) and other **style guide driven development** techniques.

We should have pure HTML and CSS here, ideally to use `/frontend/css/style.css` and the power of Sass.
