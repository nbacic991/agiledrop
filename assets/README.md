# Assets

This directory is supposed to contain all the assets received from client which includes

- design files (.ai .pdf .png .psd)
- text
- fonts in original form
- any text and Word documents
- any kind of instruction

These should be separated to their own directories usually with date trailing the name, e.g. *Design PSDs 2016-12-02*

All files should be kept in original form.

Also, here should be any modified source files like PSD that are modified to comply with needs for development (adjusted backgrounds, separated layers, etc).

All files that should be used for **frontend** build should be in `/frontend/` directory for further processing and optimization by frontend workflow.
